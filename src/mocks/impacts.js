    description1: 'A wildfire is an uncontrolled fire that burns in the wildland vegetation, often in rural areas. Wildfires can burn in forests, grasslands, savannas, and other ecosystems, and have been doing so for hundreds of millions of years. They are not limited to a particular continent or environment.',
    description2: `Wildfires can burn in vegetation located both in and above the soil. Ground fires typically ignite in soil thick with organic matter that can feed the flames, like plant roots. Ground fires can smolder for a long time—even an entire season—until conditions are right for them to grow to a surface or crown fire. Surface fires, on the other hand, burn in dead or dry vegetation that is lying or growing just above the ground. Parched grass or fallen leaves often fuel surface fires. Crown fires burn in the leaves and canopies of trees and shrubs.<p>Some regions, like the mixed conifer forests of California’s Sierra Nevada mountain range, can be affected by different types of wildfires. Sierra Nevada forest fires often include both crown and surface spots.</p>

    <p>Wildfires can start with a natural occurrence—such as a lightning strike—or a human-made spark. However, it is often the weather conditions that determine how much a wildfire grows. Wind, high temperatures, and little rainfall can all leave trees, shrubs, fallen leaves, and limbs dried out and primed to fuel a fire. Topography plays a big part too: flames burn uphill faster than they burn downhill.</p>

    <p>Wildfires that burn near communities can become dangerous and even deadly if they grow out of control. For example, the 2018 Camp Fire in Butte County, California destroyed almost the entire town of Paradise; in total, 86 people died.</p>

    <p>Still, wildfires are essential to the continued survival of some plant species. For example, some tree cones need to be heated before they open and release their seeds; chaparral plants, which include manzanita, chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum), and scrub oak (Quercus berberidifolia), require fire before seeds will germinate. The leaves of these plants include a flammable resin that feeds fire, helping the plants to propagate. Plants such as these depend on wildfires in order to pass through a regular life cycle. Some plants require fire every few years, while others require fire just a few times a century for the species to continue.</p>

    <p>Wildfires also help keep ecosystems healthy. They can kill insects and diseases that harm trees. By clearing scrub and underbrush, fires can make way for new grasses, herbs, and shrubs that provide food and habitat for animals and birds. At a low intensity, flames can clean up debris and underbrush on the forest floor, add nutrients to the soil, and open up space to let sunlight through to the ground. That sunlight can nourish smaller plants and give larger trees room to grow and flourish.</p>

    <p>While many plants and animals need and benefit from wildfires, climate change has left some ecosystems more susceptible to flames, especially in the southwest United States. Warmer temperatures have intensified drought and dried out forests. The historic practice of putting out all fires also has caused an unnatural buildup of shrubs and debris, which can fuel larger and more intense blazes.</p>

    description1: 'Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land.',
    description2: `Many things that are useful to people produce pollution. Cars spew pollutants from their exhaust pipes. Burning coal to create electricity pollutes the air. Industries and homes generate garbage and sewage that can pollute the land and water. Pesticides—chemical poisons used to kill weeds and insects—seep into waterways and harm wildlife.

    <p>All living things—from one-celled microbes to blue whales—depend on Earth’s supply of air and water. When these resources are polluted, all forms of life are threatened.</p>

    <p>Pollution is a global problem. Although urban areas are usually more polluted than the countryside, pollution can spread to remote places where no people live. For example, pesticides and other chemicals have been found in the Antarctic ice sheet. In the middle of the northern Pacific Ocean, a huge collection of microscopic plastic particles forms what is known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.</p>

    <p>Air and water currents carry pollution. Ocean currents and migrating fish carry marine pollutants far and wide. Winds can pick up radioactive material accidentally released from a nuclear reactor and scatter it around the world. Smoke from a factory in one country drifts into another country.</p>

    description1: 'Smog is air pollution that reduces visibility. The term "smog" was first used in the early 1900s to describe a mix of smoke and fog. The smoke usually came from burning coal. Smog was common in industrial areas, and remains a familiar sight in some cities today.',
    description2: `Today, most of the smog we see is photochemical smog. Photochemical smog is produced when sunlight reacts with nitrogen oxides and at least one volatile organic compound (VOC) in the atmosphere. Nitrogen oxides come from car exhaust, coal power plants, and factory emissions. VOCs are released from gasoline, paints, and many cleaning solvents. When sunlight hits these chemicals, they form airborne particles and ground-level ozone—or smog.

    <p>Ozone can be helpful or harmful. The ozone layer high in the atmosphere protects us from the sun’s dangerous ultraviolet radiation. But when ozone is close to the ground, it is bad for human health. Ozone can damage lung tissue, and it is especially dangerous to people with respiratory illnesses like asthma. Ozone can also cause itchy, burning eyes.</p>

    <p>Smog is unhealthy to humans and animals, and it can kill plants. Smog is also ugly. It makes the sky brown or gray. Smog is common in big cities with a lot of industry and traffic. Cities located in basins surrounded by mountains may have smog problems because the smog is trapped in the valley and cannot be carried away by wind. Los Angeles, California, United States, and Mexico City, Mexico, both have high smog levels partly because of this kind of landscape.</p>

    <p>Many countries, including the United States, have created laws to reduce smog. Some laws include restrictions on what chemicals a factory can release into the atmosphere, or when the factory can release them. Some communities have "burn days" when residents can burn waste such as leaves in their yard. These limits on chemicals released into the air reduce the amount of smog.</p>

    title: 'Point Source and Nonpoint Sources of Pollution',

    webp2: riverPollutionWebp2,
    description1: 'Almost everything humans do, from growing food to manufacturing products to generating electricity, has the potential to release pollution into the environment. Regulatory agencies charged with protecting the environment identify two main categories of pollution: point-source and nonpoint-source pollution.',
    description2: `Point-source pollution is easy to identify. As the name suggests, it comes from a single place. Nonpoint-source pollution is harder to identify and harder to address. It is pollution that comes from many places, all at once.

    <p>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines point source pollution as any contaminant that enters the environment from an easily identified and confined place. Examples include smokestacks, discharge pipes, and drainage ditches.</p>

    <p>Factories and power plants can be a source of point-source pollution, affecting both air and water. Smokestacks may spew carbon monoxide, heavy metal, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, or “particulate matter” (small particles) into the air. Oil refineries, paper mills, and auto plants that use water as part of their manufacturing processes can discharge effluent—wastewater containing harmful chemical pollutants—into rivers, lakes, or the ocean.</p>

    <p>Municipal wastewater treatment plants are another common source of point-source pollution. Effluent from a treatment plant can introduce nutrients and harmful microbes into waterways. Nutrients can cause a rampant growth of algae in water.</p>

    <p>Nonpoint-source pollution is the opposite of point-source pollution, with pollutants released in a wide area. As an example, picture a city street during a thunderstorm. As rainwater flows over asphalt, it washes away drops of oil that leaked from car engines, particles of tire rubber, dog waste, and trash. The runoff goes into a storm sewer and ends up in a nearby river. Runoff is a major cause of nonpoint-source pollution. It is a big problem in cities because of all the hard surfaces, including streets and roofs. The amount of pollutants washed from a single city block might be small, but when you add up the miles and miles of pavement in a big city you get a big problem.</p>

    <p>In rural areas, runoff can wash sediment from the roads in a logged-over forest tract. It can also carry acid from abandoned mines and flush pesticides and fertilizer from farm fields. All of this pollution is likely to wind up in streams, rivers, and lakes.</p>

    <p>Airborne pollutants are major contributors to acid rain. It forms in the atmosphere when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides combine with water. Because acid rain results from the long-range movement of those pollutants from many factories and power plants, it is considered nonpoint-source pollution.</p>

    <p>In the United States, the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act have helped to limit both point-source and nonpoint-source pollution. Thanks to these two legislative initiatives, in effect for some 50 years now, America’s air and water are cleaner today than they were for most of the 20th century.</p>

    webp2: noisePollutionWebp2,
    description1: 'Noise pollution is an invisible danger. It cannot be seen, but it is present nonetheless, both on land and under the sea. Noise pollution is considered to be any unwanted or disturbing sound that affects the health and well-being of humans and other organisms.',
    description2: `Sound is measured in decibels. There are many sounds in the environment, from rustling leaves (20 to 30 decibels) to a thunderclap (120 decibels) to the wail of a siren (120 to 140 decibels). Sounds that reach 85 decibels or higher can harm a person’s ears. Sound sources that exceed this threshold include familiar things, such as power lawn mowers (90 decibels), subway trains (90 to 115 decibels), and loud rock concerts (110 to 120 decibels).</p>

    <p>Noise pollution impacts millions of people on a daily basis. The most common health problem it causes is Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). Exposure to loud noise can also cause high blood pressure, heart disease, sleep disturbances, and stress. These health problems can affect all age groups, especially children. Many children who live near noisy airports or streets have been found to suffer from stress and other problems, such as impairments in memory, attention level, and reading skill.</p>

    <p>Noise pollution also impacts the health and well-being of wildlife. Studies have shown that loud noises can cause caterpillars' dorsal vessels (the insect equivalent of a heart) to beat faster, and cause bluebirds to have fewer chicks. Animals use sound for a variety of reasons, including to navigate, find food, attract mates, and avoid predators. Noise pollution makes it difficult for them to accomplish these tasks, which affects their ability survive.</p>

    <p>Increasing noise is not only affecting animals on land, it is also a growing problem for those that live in the ocean. Ships, oil drills, sonar devices, and seismic tests have made the once tranquil marine environment loud and chaotic. Whales and dolphins are particularly impacted by noise pollution. These marine mammals rely on echolocation to communicate, navigate, feed, and find mates, and excess noise interferes with their ability to effectively echolocate.</p>

    webp2: runoffWebp2,
    description1: 'Runoff occurs when there is more water than land can absorb. The excess liquid flows across the surface of the land and into nearby creeks, streams, or ponds. Runoff can come from both natural processes and human activity.',
    description2: `The most familiar type of natural runoff is snowmelt. Mountains that cannot absorb water from heavy snowfalls produce runoff that turns into streams, rivers, and lakes. Glaciers, snow, and rain all contribute to this natural runoff.

    <p>Runoff also occurs naturally as soil is eroded and carried to various bodies of water. Even toxic chemicals enter waterways through natural processes, such as volcanic eruptions. Toxic gases released by volcanoes eventually return to the water or soil as precipitation.</p>

    <p>Runoff from human activity comes from two places: point sources and nonpoint sources. Point source pollution is any source that empties directly into a waterway. This might include a pipe from specific sewage treatment plant, factory, or even a home. Regulations determine what type of runoff, and how much, industries are allowed to release. These regulations vary by region, state, and nation.</p>

    <p>Nonpoint source pollution is any source where runoff does not go directly into a waterway. Nonpoint sources of runoff can be large urban, suburban, or rural areas. In these areas, rainwater and irrigation wash chemicals into local streams. Runoff from nonpoint sources includes lawn fertilizer, car exhaust, and even spilled gasoline from a car. Farms are a huge nonpoint source of runoff, as rainwater and irrigation drain fertilizers and pesticides into bodies of water.</p>

    <p>Impervious surfaces, or surfaces that can't absorb water, increase runoff. Roads, sidewalks, and parking lots are impervious surfaces. Materials as diverse as car-washing soaps, litter, and spilled gas from a gas station all become runoff.</p>

    description1: 'Deforestation is the clear-cutting of trees in an area where forests once thrived. It’s driven primarily by logging, agriculture, and urban development and the effects on the environment are wide-reaching. It can lead to soil deterioration, stunting the growth of new trees and it can increase flooding and landslides because trees are no longer there to absorb water or anchor the ground in place with their roots.',
    description2: `Deforestation is also a major contributor to global climate change, as trees play a vital role in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. When trees are removed, they can no longer absorb and filter out carbon dioxide. This leads to an increase in greenhouse gases which traps heat and causes our climate to rise at a faster than normal rate. What’s more, cutting down trees releases even more carbon dioxide, creating more greenhouse gases.

    <p>Deforestation is also detrimental to our forests’ native species. When trees are removed, animals lose their homes and their food sources, leading to a decline in populations — potentially wiping out entire species of animals.</p>

    description1: 'Biodiversity is the variety of life on Earth and the natural ecosystems that support it. It includes the vast array of plant species and animal species that occupy the planet, as well as the genes that they contain. It’s what allows for natural ecosystems to function and thrive, and it’s essential for human survival as well. But human activities have radically altered biodiversity, with millions of species now at risk of extinction.',
    description2: `Habitat destruction, caused by deforestation, pollution, and other human activities, is the primary reason for this decline in biodiversity. As habitats are destroyed, species are losing their homes and their food sources, and they’re unable to adapt to the changes in their environment. This is leading to a dramatic decline of different species. And when one species disappears, it can mean the loss of a food source for another, causing a higher likelihood of various animals going extinct.

    <p>This can ultimately lead to the collapse of an entire ecosystem, which would have devastating consequences for all life on Earth, including humans. Humans depend on local biodiversity for a variety of resources, including nutrition. Take, for example, wild bees. In recent years, the bee population has decreased significantly because of habitat loss, pollution, and the use of pesticides. However, they are responsible for 1 in 3 bites of food we take at our dinner tables. Without their pollinating abilities, many of the foods we rely on would not be able to grow (e.g. apples, cranberries, and broccoli). Maintaining biodiversity is incredibly important as it allows us to continue eating the many foods that are necessary for our daily lives.</p>
